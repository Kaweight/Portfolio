# Kamil Mazelanik Portfolio

## About

This is a portfolio page of a front-end developer based on technologies such as HTML, SCSS, JavaScript ES6, The aim of the landing page is to introduce the recipients to my works and myself.

## Features

The page consists of 4 main sections (About Me, Experience, Works, Contact).
I stuck to the BEM methodology and if there was a need I created pure JavaScript.

Development wise, it also uses:

- GIT - for version control
- Gulp - for package managing
